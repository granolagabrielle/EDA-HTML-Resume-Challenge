                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello and welcome to my resume! I'm Gabrielle, an aspiring software developer. I've worked in higher education for the last 4 years, 
                    and I've found a passion for writing code and building things. I'm an adaptable, self-motivated and quick-learning professional. 
                    Outside of work, you can find me knitting, baking bread or spending time with my dogs and partner.
